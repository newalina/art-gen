// Status of work for Alec

List to Do (In Order of Importance):
* Connect all patches to AGD
  - Part of this is making file loading in TD path relative, not absolute. 
* Implement robust error logging in both Python and TD
  - Look into why logging is inconsistent when running with app.py.
    o Is something overwriting the file when passed to a new object?
* Create Garbage Collection Scheme
* Create guide to installing and running the backend
